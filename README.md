This project covers brain tumor classification utilizing classical machine learning, random forest, to segment parts of an MRI scan which is indicated as a tumor. The output of the model is a binary mask of the tumor area (white) and non tumor area (black). This repository also covers the report, dataset, app code, and experiment notebook to generate the model.
## Experiment results
The model achieved the following metrics on evaluation: 
- Accuracy: 0.9514
- Dice/F1 Score: 0.9527
